# KingOfZambodia
Notes and Samples of MongoDB course.
For those not from the Memphis area, Prince Mongo, King of Zambodia is an eccentric nightclub owner and local politician who grew up as a high school classmate of my father in Norfolk, Virginia, then turned up decades later in my mother's hometown, Memphis, as one of its most colorful citizens. I do not have any knowledge that he is in any way connected with non-relational databases of any kind.
